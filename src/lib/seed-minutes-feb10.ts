Each member of the public shall only have one opportunity to speak during each public portion. As the technology does not allow us to know if there are multiple callers on an individual phone line or logged in user account, we ask that if you wish to speak, that you login in or dial in separately so that we can recognize you as a separate individual.\n\nShould you have any further comments or questions, the Township Council is always available by email and phone, and you can always call the Mayor's office during normal operating hours.\n\nOn roll call, there were present: Councilmembers Cahill, Carmichael, Espinosa, Leibowitz, Rashid, Uhrin, & Council President Lombardi.\n\nCouncil President Lombardi led the salute to the flag.\n\nCouncil President Lombardi read the following proclamation:\n\nPROCLAMATION RECOGNIZING BLACK HISTORY MONTH\n\nWHEREAS, Black History Month is observed each February to celebrate the culture and achievements of African-Americans whose contributions have strengthened and enriched our nation; and\n\nWHEREAS, Black History Month also provides a crucial opportunity for all Americans to learn, understand, and reflect on the enormous burdens and sacrifices placed on African-Americans, including the brutality and lasting impacts of transatlantic human trade and Jim Crow laws; and\n\nWHEREAS, historical sites and narratives related to all aspects of past and present African-American life must be preserved to properly guide the shaping of our nation into a truly more perfect union; and\n\nWHEREAS, New Jersey and Middlesex County in particular have been the home to a full breadth of the African-American experience; and\n\nWHEREAS, numerous slave ships brought enslaved African-Americans to destinations of subjugation through Perth Amboy; and\n\nWHEREAS, Thomas Mundy Peterson of the same municipality was the first African-American man to vote after the passage of the 15th Amendment of the Constitution; and\n\nWHEREAS, among the collection of historical structures of East Jersey Olde Town Village in Piscataway, the Hogland House was home to a free African-American who purchased it in 1862 and lived in it until 1899; and\n\nWHEREAS, African-Americans continue to play a vital role in shaping our nation, contributing mightily to its economic, cultural, spiritual and political growth;\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, I, Brian C. Wahler, Mayor of Piscataway Township in the County of Middlesex, State of New Jersey, do hereby recognize the month of February as Black History Month and encourage all residents to acknowledge the contributions and enduring legacy of African-Americans in our community and country.\n\nBrian C. Wahler, Mayor\n\nCOMMENTS FROM ADMINISTRATION AND COUNCIL REGARDING ADJOURNMENT OF ANY MATTERS ON THIS AGENDA\n\nCouncilmember Leibowitz stated that she supported the goal of licensing hotels and motels to ensure appropriate safety, fire, and zoning standards are met. However, she remained concerned about unintended consequences embedded in certain provisions of the ordinance. She raised these concerns prior to the first reading and vote and supported moving the ordinance forward at that stage with the understanding that the language would be further reviewed before final adoption and that the public would have an opportunity to review and provide meaningful feedback. She listened carefully to the testimony from business owners and employees on January 20th. No one should feel unsafe in their place of work and she could not imagine the fear and uncertainty they described. She was also deeply concerned that it had taken years for meaningful action to address these long-standing issues. Those who testified deserve better and she was committed to ensuring their concerns are addressed in a way that is both effective and fair. Many of the issues raised, particularly loitering and criminal activity, would not be addressed through hotel and motel licensing alone. A letter submitted by ACLU policy counsel, domestic violence survivor advocates, housing professionals, supportive housing practitioners, re-entry service providers, and others working at this intersection of homelessness and community safety raised serious concerns that the ordinance, as currently written, could result in significant harm to vulnerable individuals and families without resolving the underlying problems it seeks to address. Therefore, Councilmember Leibowitz made a motion that the council remove the ordinance from the agenda at this time. The township administration and council should consult with experts that have raised concerns to ensure that the provisions do not have unintentional consequences on taxpayers and those who are housed in the hotels and motels.\n\nCouncil President Lombardi asked for a second. Councilmember Rashid seconded the motion.\n\nCouncil President Lombardi called for a roll call vote on whether to remove the ordinance from the agenda.\n\nOn roll call vote: Councilmembers Cahill, Carmichael, Espinosa, and Uhrin voted to keep it on the agenda. Councilmembers Leibowitz and Rashid voted yes to remove it from the agenda. Council President Lombardi voted to keep it on the agenda. The motion to remove the ordinance from the agenda failed.\n\nCouncilmember Rashid requested to remove item 10M from the consent agenda to vote on it separately. Township Clerk Seader advised that she could abstain from the complete consent agenda or vote yes on the others and abstain from that item. Councilmember Rashid indicated she would abstain from that item only.\n\nPUBLIC COMMENT ON CONSENT AGENDA — REMOTE ATTENDEES\n\nCouncil President Lombardi opened the meeting to the remote attendees for comments regarding the Consent Agenda items. There being no comments, this portion of the meeting was closed to the public.\n\nPUBLIC COMMENT ON CONSENT AGENDA — IN PERSON ATTENDEES\n\nCouncil President Lombardi opened the meeting to the in person attendees for comments regarding the Consent Agenda items. There being no comments, this portion of the meeting was closed to the public.\n\nThe Clerk read for SECOND READING the following ORDINANCE:\n\nAN ORDINANCE TO AMEND AND SUPPLEMENT THE REVISED GENERAL ORDINANCES OF THE TOWNSHIP OF PISCATAWAY, COUNTY OF MIDDLESEX, STATE OF NEW JERSEY, AMENDING CHAPTER 7, TRAFFIC SECTION 14, PARKING PROHIBITED AT ALL TIMES ON CERTAIN STREETS\n\n[REVIEW: full ordinance text needed @13:22]\n\nCouncil President Lombardi opened the meeting to remote attendees for comments. There being no comments, the public portion was closed.\n\nCouncil President Lombardi opened the meeting to in person attendees for comments. There being no comments, the public portion was closed.\n\nRESOLUTION offered by Councilmember Cahill, seconded by Councilmember [REVIEW: name unclear @14:23], BE IT RESOLVED, by the Township Council of Piscataway Township, New Jersey, that AN ORDINANCE ENTITLED: AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND AND SUPPLEMENT THE REVISED GENERAL ORDINANCES OF THE TOWNSHIP OF PISCATAWAY, COUNTY OF MIDDLESEX, STATE OF NEW JERSEY, AMENDING CHAPTER 7, TRAFFIC SECTION 14, PARKING PROHIBITED AT ALL TIMES ON CERTAIN STREETS was introduced on the 20th day of January 2026 and had passed the first reading and was published on the 25th day of January 2026.\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the aforesaid Ordinance, having had a second reading on February 10, 2026, be adopted, passed, and after passage, be published, together with a notice of the date of passage or approval, in the official newspaper.\n\nBE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that this Ordinance shall be assigned No. 2026-05.\n\nOn roll call vote: Councilmembers Cahill, Carmichael, Espinosa, Leibowitz, Rashid, Uhrin, & Council President Lombardi answered yes.\n\nThe Clerk read for SECOND READING the following ORDINANCE:\n\nAN ORDINANCE TO AMEND AND SUPPLEMENT THE REVISED GENERAL ORDINANCES OF THE TOWNSHIP OF PISCATAWAY, COUNTY OF MIDDLESEX, STATE OF NEW JERSEY, ADDING CHAPTER 4, LICENSING AND BUSINESS REGULATIONS, SECTION 16, HOTELS AND MOTELS\n\n[REVIEW: full ordinance text needed @15:23]\n\nCouncil President Lombardi stated that this ordinance was built for the residents and business owners of Piscataway, the very people who make the township strong. The council collaborated together and with colleagues to ensure this ordinance was crafted responsibly and thoroughly. The township attorney worked tirelessly consulting with colleagues and townships across the state to ensure this ordinance reflects the strongest and most effective practices. Above all, this is about putting the people of Piscataway first, their safety, their well-being, and their peace of mind. It is about protecting the quality of life in the community and ensuring that Piscataway remains a place where families and businesses can continue to thrive.\n\nCouncil President Lombardi opened the meeting to remote attendees for comments.\n\nJessica Kratovil, 1247 Brookside Road, stated this was a poorly written ordinance unlikely to solve the purported issue and would have numerous detrimental impacts, including displacing innocent people going through hard times and violating the Fourth Amendment per City of Los Angeles v. Patel precedent.\n\nBrian Rak, 1247 Brookside Road, described the ordinance as unusual and questioned why the town was pushing it so hard, comparing it to a landlord-tenant dispute rather than a public safety issue.\n\nRaisa Rubenstein, policy associate for the New Jersey Coalition to End Homelessness, raised concerns about the ordinance's impact given the 57% increase in homelessness statewide and the lack of shelters in Middlesex County, where hotels and motels often serve as de facto shelter.\n\n[REVIEW: speaker name unclear @26:34], director of system programs at Coming Home in charge of homeless systems for Middlesex County, stated it was disturbing to see vulnerable populations targeted and that people would literally die in the cold if evicted from hotels with nowhere to go.\n\nKapil Shah, 423 Netherwood Avenue, supported the ordinance, stating it was not against homeless people but for the safety of residents who work near the businesses.\n\nThere being no further comments, the public portion was closed.\n\nTownship Attorney Goomer clarified that the ordinance does not contain the language from East Brunswick that was read by a prior speaker, and that only code enforcement can access guest logs specifically for compliance with the ordinance, not the police department.\n\nCouncil President Lombardi opened the meeting to in person attendees for comments.\n\nSierra Hart, director of housing and economic justice with the New Jersey Coalition to End Domestic Violence, urged the council to remove the ordinance, stating it would cause significant harm to survivors of domestic violence by placing arbitrary limits on stays and requiring sharing of guest information.\n\n    ○ Council President Lombardi responded that unfortunately many of the calls at that hotel are domestic violence calls, which is part of what is going on there.\n\nSima Torres, director of the Middlesex County Family Justice Center with Women Aware, expressed serious concerns about the ordinance limiting hotel and motel stays for victims and survivors of domestic violence and requiring sharing of identifying information with township code enforcement, stating it removes speed, privacy, and discretion that victims need.\n\nDwan Norwood, policy counsel at the ACLU of New Jersey, urged rejection of the ordinance, stating it would lead to further harm against vulnerable communities and potentially violate protections provided by the New Jersey Constitution and the Law Against Discrimination, citing concerns about privacy intrusion, discrimination based on prior convictions, and due process violations.\n\n    ○ Township Attorney Goomer stated there had been thorough review of this ordinance by multiple counsel for constitutional issues and the council made a recommendation on enforcement.\n\nHeather Sims, deputy director of advocacy and peer services at Collaborative Support Programs of New Jersey, spoke as someone who once lived in a motel with her two children while waiting for a housing voucher after fleeing an abusive relationship, stating that temporary motel placement was a bridge that allowed her to build a career and become a homeowner.\n\nEileen O'Donnell, executive director of Coming Home of Middlesex County, questioned the 89-day rule, stating it does not stop someone with a criminal conviction from staying in a hotel and does not solve the issue, and noted that the ordinance does not provide an appeal for guests seeking extensions.\n\nAnne Thieling, chief operating officer at Collaborative Support Programs of New Jersey, stated that in state fiscal year 2025 their agency served 1,744 unique individuals seeking supportive housing services with an average length of stay of 128 days needed to stabilize and transition to permanent housing, and that an 89-day cap would end support before individuals could secure stable housing.\n\nSheila Mazar, 46 Wickley Avenue, speaking for herself and as a representative of the League of Women Voters of the Greater New Brunswick area, stated the ordinance was too broad and would harm law-abiding motel and hotel guests trying to get back on their feet, and asked the council to form a task force to work with housing experts.\n\nStaci Berger, 233 Ellis Parkway, president and CEO of the Housing and Community Development Network of New Jersey, questioned why the council would undermine best practices for improving public safety and housing stability and noted that the crime update sent by the township mentioned people being released from incarceration but the ordinance does nothing to address that population, and stated that Woodbridge has a comprehensive approach through CPTED training rather than limiting length of stay.\n\nDana Gabriel, business owner of Gabriel's Barn & Grill, stated her employees shared personal experiences at the last meeting that were not exaggerated and that the situation has changed significantly in the past five years, and expressed gratitude that the council came up with the ordinance while acknowledging it may not be perfect.\n\n    ○ Council President Lombardi called for public order when there was disruption in the audience.\n\nRalph Johnson, former command law enforcement officer and longtime resident, stated he understood the desire to take action but the ordinance as written does not address underlying issues, and suggested evidence-based strategies including data-driven policing, focus deterrence, community partnerships, environmental design improvements, code enforcement that does not violate civil rights, and cross-agency collaboration.\n\nNancy Cordino, 14 Jefferson Drive, former board of education member, stated that as a board of education member the primary responsibility was educating students and keeping them safe, and the council's primary responsibility is keeping the community safe.\n\nReena Patel, social worker and peer advocate for Middlesex County, stated the council was targeting certain individuals using stigmatizing labels, that returning citizens have the right to reintegrate into society, that the proposed registry would be an easy way to target people and throw them in jail for no reason, and suggested working with social services rather than against them citing Newton Township Police Department's homeless task force as an example.\n\nNancy Salgado Cow, 124 Stanton Avenue, speaking as current president of the school board in her personal capacity, stated that safety entails the whole person including mental health and social services, questioned what the ordinance does for people needing help, and suggested creating a task force where community members could be part of the solution.\n\nRichard Ebert, 48 Wagner Avenue, thanked the mayor and council for the proposed ordinance stating it was a great first step to help deter criminal activity, asked what steps were being taken to increase police surveillance in the Motel 6 area and whether reconstituting the vice narcotics unit would be considered, and asked whether the township had financial recourse to the county or state to recoup costs of police work and EMS.\n\n    ○ Council President Lombardi stated there had been numerous conversations with the director of public safety about increasing regular patrols in the area over the past few months, but it had not resolved the issues which is why additional steps were being taken.\n\nThere being no further comments, the public portion was closed.\n\nRESOLUTION offered by Councilmember Cahill, seconded by Councilmember Uhrin, BE IT RESOLVED, by the Township Council of Piscataway Township, New Jersey, that AN ORDINANCE ENTITLED: AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND AND SUPPLEMENT THE REVISED GENERAL ORDINANCES OF
