You will be given a transcript, chapter markers, and agenda items. Produce minutes INDISTINGUISHABLE from what the Clerk writes by hand.

TRANSCRIPT NOTE: ${transcriptNote}

KNOWN NAMES — use these EXACT spellings (the transcript WILL misspell them):
- Council Members (2026): Brescher, Coyle, Dima, Harris (Council Vice President), Kentos, Patel (Council President), Patel, Patil, Shmuel
- Staff: Township Clerk Russomanno, Deputy Clerk McCray, Township Attorney Rainone, Business Administrator Alves-Viveiros, CFO Vallejo, Director of Finance DeRoberts, Police Sgt. Mieczkowski, Fire Chief Toth, Cameraman Bhatty
- When referring to staff in discussion: Mr. Rainone, Ms. Alves-Viveiros, Mr. DeRoberts, etc.

ABSOLUTE RULES:
- Output plain text only — NO markdown (no #, **, ---, bullet points)
- Do NOT invent information. If unclear, omit rather than guess. Never write [inaudible] or [unclear].
- "Councilmembers" is ONE word (not "Council Members" or "Council members")
- Council President is always listed LAST when listing councilmember names
- The word is "Councilmember" (singular) when referring to one person: "Councilmember Patil asked..."
- All discussion is PARAPHRASED, never verbatim quoted
- Use present tense for paraphrasing what people said: "Councilmember Patil asked..." not "Councilmember Patil had asked..."`;

  if (meetingType === "work_session") {
    return `${baseContext}

YOU ARE PRODUCING WORK SESSION MINUTES. These are deliberately BRIEF — typically 3 pages when printed.

=== EXACT STRUCTURE (follow this order precisely) ===

1. TITLE BLOCK (centered):
MINUTES OF
MUNICIPAL COUNCIL
WORKSESSION MEETING
[Full date, e.g. January 12, 2026]

2. PREAMBLE (use this EXACT sentence, only changing time and president name):
"A Worksession Meeting of the Municipal Council of the Township of Piscataway was held in the Council Chambers of the Municipal Complex. The meeting was called to order at [TIME] by Council President [Name] followed by the Pledge of Allegiance."

Time format: "6:04 p.m." (with space before p.m.)

3. ATTENDANCE:
"Present were Councilmembers [names comma-separated, Council President listed last]"

Then if anyone absent: "Councilmember [Name] was absent." or "Councilmember [Name] and [Name] were absent."
If someone arrived late: "Councilmember [Name] entered at [time]." (time format: 6:08pm, no space)

4. STAFF (use "Deputy Clerk" not "Deputy Township Clerk" for work sessions):
"Also present were Township Clerk Russomanno, Deputy Clerk McCray, Township Attorney Rainone, Business Administrator Alves-Viveiros, [other staff present] and Cameraman Bhatty"

Staff are listed by title and last name only. Cameraman Bhatty always LAST.

5. OPMA NOTICE (use this EXACT paragraph, only changing the notice date):
"The Township Clerk advised that adequate notice of this meeting, as required by the Open Public Meetings Act of 1975, has been provided by an Annual Notice sent to The Home News Tribune, The Star Ledger, Desi Talk and News India Times on November 17, 2025 and posted in the Main Lobby of the Municipal Complex on the same date."

6. VIDEO LINK:
"This meeting is available on the following link:"
[blank line]
[URL]

7. NUMBERED SECTIONS — each section follows this format:
[number]. [TITLE IN ALL CAPS]

For department sections: "[number]. FROM THE [DEPARTMENT NAME]:"
Sub-items: "a. through [letter]." for multiple items, just "a." for single items
"No comments were made." when no discussion occurred

CRITICAL — how to write sections WITH discussion:
- The clerk paraphrases casually in 1-3 sentences. She does NOT list individual concerns.
- Pattern: "Councilmember [Name] asked/questioned/said [brief paraphrase]."
- Staff responses: "Mr./Ms. [Name] explained/replied [brief paraphrase]."
- Keep it conversational, not formal. The clerk writes how people talk.
- For PRESENTATIONS: When the Council President "reads into the record," include ONLY the prepared statement. Do NOT include reactions, thanks, or comments from other council members about the presentation — those belong under Discussion Items only if the member lists them.

For ORDINANCES in Proposed Ordinances section:
- Write the ordinance title in ALL CAPS
- Then "No comments were made." or the discussion summary

8. ORAL PETITIONS AND REMARKS:
THIS IS THE SECTION WHERE BREVITY IS MOST CRITICAL. The clerk gives an extremely compressed summary.
Each speaker gets 1-3 SENTENCES maximum. Do NOT list specific ordinance numbers, legal citations, addresses, or detailed concerns. Summarize at the HIGHEST level.

GOOD example (from actual minutes): "Akhtar Nasser, passed out to all Councilmembers, Attorney and Administration a summary of questions, state statues and ordinances. He will meet with the Attorney after the meeting. The Attorney will review all his concerns."

BAD example (too detailed): "Dr. Akhtar Nasser raised concerns about ordinance compliance at 1039 Amboy Avenue, including parking variances, sidewalk waivers, and ADA compliance..." — the clerk would NEVER write this level of detail.

Format: "[First name] [Last name], [very brief paraphrase]. [Brief response if any]."

Then ALWAYS close with:
"Hearing no further comments, this public hearing was closed, on a motion made by Councilmember [Name] seconded by Councilmember [Name], with all in favor."

9. POINTS OF LIGHT:
"Council President [Name] announced the following upcoming events."
Then list events with dates, times, and locations in flowing narrative (not bullet points).

10. DISCUSSION ITEMS (singular "DISCUSSION ITEM:" if only one round):
List EACH councilmember alphabetically by last name, Council President LAST:

Councilmember [Name]:
a. [topic] or a. None or a. Absent

Council President [Name]
a. [topic or message]

11. ADJOURNMENT (use this EXACT pattern):
"On a motion made by Councilmember [Name] seconded by Councilmember [Name] with all in favor, the meeting was adjourned at [TIME]"
Time format for adjournment: "6:43pm" (no space, no periods in pm)

12. SIGNATURE BLOCK:

_______________________________    ____________________________________________
[Council President full name]                          Cheryl Russomanno, RMC
Council President                     Municipal Clerk

=== REAL EXAMPLE FROM JAN 12, 2026 ACTUAL CLERK MINUTES ===

Study how the clerk handles Section 4 (long presentation summarized in 2 paragraphs), Section 6 (ordinances with mixed discussion/no discussion), Section 7 (brief one-line comment), and Section 12 (oral petitions with 2 speakers):

4.       PRESENTATION 250TH ANNIVERSARY OF OUR COUNTRY

         Council President Coyle read into the record:

         [The clerk included Coyle's FULL prepared statement verbatim — about 15 lines covering America 250, Edison's Revolutionary heritage, Edison TV historic series, Edison High Drama Class presentation, and America 250 flag presentation]

         Council Vice President Kentos, he is part of Rev 250 Committee gave a brief overview of the Committee function and events.

5.      ADMINISTRATIVE AGENDA
        FROM MAYOR JOSHI:
        a. through m          No comments were made

6.      PROPOSED ORDINANCES:

        ORDINANCE AMENDING ARTICLE V, "BOARDS, COMMISSIONS, COMMITTEES AND
        AGENCIES," OF CHAPTER 2, "ADMINISTRATION," OF THE MUNICIPAL CODE.
        No comments were made.

        ORDINANCE AMENDING CHAPTER 39, "LAND USE," SECTION §39-12.15, "TECHNICAL
        REVIEW COMMITTEE," OF THE CODE OF THE TOWNSHIP OF EDISON

        Councilmember Patil asked because this won't be a public meeting, will those meeting minutes be documented and available on the website.

        Mr. Rainone explained the way this is being redesigned and part of the reason why the changes is going on because the Technical Review Committee is really just that it's a technical review of the application. Once those notes are done that application then will go to the planning board, so yes, by that nature they would be publicly available. He explained the purpose is to streamline the process.

7.      FROM THE BUSINESS ADMINISTRATOR:
        a. through u.     Councilmember Patil is happy to see the change in contracts.

12.     ORAL PTEITIONS AND REMARKS:

        Akhtar Nasser, passed out to all Councilmembers, Attorney and Administration a summary of questions, state statues and ordinances. He will meet with the Attorney after the meeting. The Attorney will review all his concerns.

        Anthony DeAmorin suggested, as a point of recommendation the council to allow back and forth with the public.

=== KEY OBSERVATIONS FROM THE EXAMPLE ===
- Section 5: "a. through m" and "No comments were made" appear on the SAME line when space permits
- Section 7: Comment appears on the SAME line as "a. through u." when brief
- Section 4: The clerk included ONLY Coyle's prepared statement and ONE line about Kentos. She did NOT include reactions from Patel, Patil, or anyone else. Presentations are the statement itself + at most 1 summary line. Do NOT add paragraphs about other members' reactions.
- Section 6: Ordinance discussion is casual paraphrasing, not formal summary
- Section 12 (Oral Petitions): Nasser got 3 sentences. DeAmorin got 1 sentence. This is the correct level of brevity. Do NOT list specific legal concerns, ordinance numbers, or addresses.
- The clerk's style is conversational and sometimes grammatically informal

CRITICAL FINAL RULES:
- The ENTIRE work session minutes should be 70-90 lines. If your output is longer, you are being too detailed.
- Oral Petitions: 1-3 sentences per speaker MAXIMUM. Summarize the TOPIC, not the details.
- Presentations: Include only what was formally "read into the record." Do NOT transcribe subsequent discussion.
- Discussion Items: Just list topic keywords (1-3 words) or "None"/"Absent". Do NOT write full sentences.
- If the transcript shows someone was absent (no response at roll call, or listed as absent), they MUST appear as absent in both the attendance section AND the Discussion Items section.`;

  const prompt = `Analyze this Edison Township Council meeting transcript to determine what happened to each ordinance.

CONTEXT: Edison Township, NJ (Faulkner Act Mayor-Council). The transcript is from a speech-to-text system — names may be misspelled.

MEETING TYPE: ${meetingType === "work_session" ? "Work Session (ordinances are discussed/presented, may be read by title for first reading)" : "Regular Meeting (formal first readings with roll call votes, public hearings, and adoption votes)"}
MEETING DATE: ${meetingDate}

ORDINANCES ON AGENDA:
${ordinanceList}

TRANSCRIPT:
${transcript}

For each ordinance, determine the outcome by listening for:
- Motions ("I move to...", "motion to introduce", "motion to adopt")
- Seconds ("seconded by...")
- Roll call votes (individual "aye"/"nay" responses from council members)
- Procedural language ("passed on first reading", "public hearing is now open", "ordinance is adopted", "tabled", "laid on the table", "sent back to committee")
- The presiding officer's declarations ("the ordinance is adopted", "motion carries")

Respond with a JSON array:
[
  {
    "docket_id": <number>,
    "outcome": "<one of: introduced, hearing_held, adopted, failed, tabled, amended, not_mentioned>",
    "vote_result": "<e.g. '7-0' or '6-1' — count ayes vs nays from roll call, or null if no vote taken>",
    "notes": "<brief note, e.g. 'Passed first reading 7-0' or 'Public hearing held, 2 speakers, adopted 6-1 (Patil nay)' or 'Tabled at request of administration'>"
  }
]

Outcome meanings:
- "introduced": Ordinance was read by title and/or passed first reading vote
- "hearing_held": Public hearing was opened and closed but NOT adopted in this meeting
- "adopted": Ordinance passed final adoption vote (may include hearing in same meeting)
- "failed": Vote failed or ordinance was defeated
- "tabled": Ordinance was tabled / postponed / laid on table / sent back to committee
- "amended": Ordinance was substantially amended during hearing (process may restart)
- "not_mentioned": Cannot find this ordinance discussed in the transcript

IMPORTANT:
- At regular meetings, an ordinance may have BOTH a public hearing and adoption vote. If adopted, use "adopted".
- At work sessions, ordinances are typically discussed but not formally voted on. If only discussed with no motion/vote, use "introduced" since the work session IS the introduction/first reading in Edison's process.
- Count actual roll call responses for vote_result, don't guess.
